This was built as part of the CompatibleONE research project to
create a distributed NoSQL based XWiki instance. There are many
nice things in here and anyone interested in revitalizing the
XWiki storage system is encouraged to poke around and see if any
material may be reusable.

To see the final result of this project, checkout the
`compatibleone-wiki-nodes-demo` repository.
